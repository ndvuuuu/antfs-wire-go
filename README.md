## 🧭 Overview

AntGo-Sync is a distinctive, opinionated evolution of the openant-go lineage — a Go-native library and runtime bridge purpose-built for talking to ANT and ANT-FS enabled wearable sensors, fitness trackers, and embedded telemetry devices. Where the original Python `openant` library laid the groundwork, AntGo-Sync reshapes that foundation into a concurrent, resilient, and delightfully approachable toolkit for the modern Go ecosystem.

Think of it as a **translator stationed at the border between two worlds**: the low-level, timing-sensitive wireless chatter of ANT/ANT-FS hardware on one side, and the high-level, idiomatic, goroutine-friendly patterns of contemporary cloud and edge services on the other. AntGo-Sync doesn't just pipe bytes — it listens, negotiates, retries, decrypts, and hands your application clean, structured, meaningful events.

Whether you are building a training-log ingestion pipeline, a wellness dashboard backend, a research-grade biometric collection system, or an industrial IoT fleet management layer, AntGo-Sync gives you a dependable bridge without forcing you to speak fluent ANT in your spare time.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

The ANT protocol family has been a quiet workhorse in endurance sports, health monitoring, and low-power sensor networks for years. Yet the tooling around it has often felt like a locked toolbox: powerful, but stubbornly Python-shaped, single-threaded by default, and awkward to embed inside a Go microservice mesh.

AntGo-Sync exists to change that narrative. It reinterprets the classic ANT/ANT-FS dialogue through a lens that values:

- **Concurrency by default** — channels, sessions, and transfers are goroutine-aware.
- **Failure tolerance** — wireless links are noisy; the library assumes disruption and recovers gracefully.
- **Observability** — structured logging, metrics hooks, and trace-friendly context propagation.
- **Ergonomic APIs** — you should be able to read a device's telemetry in a handful of lines.
- **Long-term maintainability** — a single, coherent codebase with predictable versioning.

## 🧩 Architecture at a Glance

AntGo-Sync is layered deliberately, much like a well-built bridge has deck, cables, and anchors. Each layer can be used independently or composed into a full stack.

1. **Transport Layer** — speaks to physical or virtual ANT sticks.
2. **Channel Layer** — manages logical ANT channels and their state machines.
3. **Session Layer** — handles ANT-FS negotiation, authentication, and transfer primitives.
4. **Codec Layer** — converts raw pages into typed structs and back.
5. **Application Layer** — offers friendly, high-level APIs and streaming adapters.

The separation means you can swap a real transport for a simulated one during CI, replace the codec registry with your own decoders, or embed just the session layer inside a larger orchestration platform.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Conceptual Flow)

You don't need a ritual of terminal incantations to begin. The intended adoption path looks like this:

1. **Reference the module** in your Go workspace manifest, pinned to a tagged release.
2. **Instantiate a transport** — either a hardware-backed one or the in-memory simulated transport.
3. **Open a coordinator** and let it discover nearby devices.
4. **Bind a channel** to a device profile that matches your sensor.
5. **Subscribe to events** and pipe them wherever your application needs them.
6. **Close cleanly** when your service shuts down; the coordinator handles draining.

A minimal mental model: coordinator → channel → session → stream. Everything else is configuration.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Themes for 2026

- **Adaptive Channel Scheduling** — intelligent arbitration when many channels compete for limited bandwidth.
- **Expanded Decoder Library** — broader coverage of vendor-specific page layouts.
- **Enhanced Dashboard** — deeper drill-down views and exportable session reports.
- **Protocol Fuzzing Harness** — hardened input validation through systematic adversarial testing.
- **Language Pack Expansion** — additional locales driven by community contributions.
- **Observability Integrations** — first-class hooks for popular metrics and tracing ecosystems.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

Quality in AntGo-Sync is treated as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. The repository embraces:

- **Simulated transports** for deterministic unit tests.
- **Recorded session fixtures** for regression coverage of protocol edge cases.
- **Table-driven tests** for codec and decoder correctness.
- **Race detector runs** in continuous integration for concurrency safety.
- **Benchmark suites** tracking throughput and latency across releases.

If you contribute a feature, expect to contribute a test alongside it — that's simply the culture here.
